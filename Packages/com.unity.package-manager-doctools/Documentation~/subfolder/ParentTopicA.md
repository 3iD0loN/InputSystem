# Nested Content


To nest topics in the TOC, indent those items in the list:

```
* [Documentation Tool](index)
* [External Links](ExternalLinks.md)
* [Parent Topic](subfolder/ParentTopicA.md)
    * [Child Topic B](subfolder/subfolder/ChildTopicB.md)
    * [Child Topic C](ChildTopicC.md)
```

Note that you can use subfolders to organize your markdown files. This folder structure is preserved in the html output. However, folder structure is independent of nesting in the TOC.
