More info in the [wiki](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/InputSystem/wiki).

[Preview builds of the Unity editor](http://beta.unity3d.com/download/4f520c3a3153/public_download.html) that work with the project. It is not usable with any other Unity 2018.1 build.

>NOTE: This system is still experimental and not yet stable. Active development happens in the `develop` branch. The `master` branch is compatible with the preview builds above; the `develop` branch isn't.
